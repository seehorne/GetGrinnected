My work examines the ways in which these landscapes intersect and are altered by such intersections. Paper becomes the “border-line surface,” the membrane that divides and connects what is inside us and what is outside.\n\n\n  Landscape consists not only of the physical realities of our surroundings, but of our relationship to those realities. J. Douglas Porteous calls landscape “a visual construct [that] does not exist without an observer.” In observing, we project ourselves onto and into the landscape. Individual landscapes, however, also dictate how we observe them. The landscape is inside us as much as we are inside it.\n\n\n  My prints act as representations and embodiments of this interplay of outer and inner space. I represent relationships and the spaces that contain and create them abstractly, in hopes that viewers will use the space of the landscape as a site for meditation on the relationships and spaces in their own lives. Often, ink transfers from the block to the paper, but the residue of previous impressions also transfers from the paper back to the block and then onto subsequent prints. Through this exchange, the surface documents a conversation, the way we are changed by contact with new environments and ideas. In installation or book form, this surface expands to form its own environment.\n\n\n  My recent work engages the reciprocal relationship between inner and outer space, between people and our environments, in the landscapes of the Western and Midwestern United States.&#160; ceding clouds, Controlled Burn and Fire Maps explore this relationship through the lens of ?re — the imprints left by wild?re, on the part of the landscape, and prescribed burns, on the part of people. Emigrant Lake[s] addresses drought’s effects on the Western landscape and its population. Lagoons and Fringe Landscapes emerge from the beauties and horrors of modern agriculture. Lagoons references the lurid colors of the waste containment tanks used by industrial hog farms. Fringe Landscapes arises from the notion of a corn field as a grassland that contains our longing for the now-gone prairie grasslands. defensible space and a belly full of water against the future drought use cactus imagery to interrogate issues surrounding borders and scarcity.\n\n\n  Across these bodies of work, the tent form is emblematic of the tenuous nature of our relationship to our surroundings, an object that allows us to connect with the landscape, to spend time in it, by separating and protecting us from it.\n","Audience":["Students"],"Org":"Art Department","Tags":["Alum Involvement"],"ID":30324},

Made in collaboration with Columbia College and DePaul professors and a Northwestern PhD student, this documentary film about place is a Piscator/ Brecht/Deavere Smith-influenced montage of interviews of Evanston locals with divergent viewpoints. Interpreted by actors, seven diverse residents address issues of identity, belonging, and home in a progressive city: but one in which conversations often do not cross demographic boundaries. Issues include homelessness, racial equity and reparations, diversity and inclusivity, community policing, climate change, and immigration/displacement/remaking the self in this place.&#160; Using techniques of ethnographic (or verbatim) theatre, engaging constructions of film and theatrical “reality,” the documentary’s activism springs from the Brechtian question, “Why does it have to be this way?”&#160; It reflects on inequality, resourcefulness, and commitment as substrates for stories of individual loss, striving, and belonging—or not–in a city.&#160; This workshop version of the film encourages audiences’ active viewing and speaking up, engaging in philosopher Linda Alcoff’s “speaking with” rather than the positionality of “speaking for” or “as” in discussion.&#160; It encourages attendees to connect with stories of belonging/ unbelonging in their own locations.\n\n\n  Lesley Delmenico is an associate professor of Theatre and Performance Studies (M.A., Ph.D. Northwestern University).&#160; Her work on theatre and politics explores intersections of performance, post-coloniality, gender, and immigration, concentrating on the ways that marginalized women improvise speaking spaces in urban settings.&#160; An ethnographic/verbatim playwright and director, she has created professional and community-based performances in London, Grinnell, Evanston IL, and Mumbai. No Bad Women, adapted from a landmark British trial, was a sold-out London production in 2019.&#160; Her article, “Performing Public Presence: African Migrant Women Create&#160;Uncomfortable Conversations&#160;in London,” was featured by Cambridge University Press for International Women’s Day, 2020.&#160;&#160;Recent adaptations/directions for performance and film include More than Skin Deep,&#160;an inter-racial conversation with Prof. Jan Gross (Grinnell College) and Prof. Heather Lobban-Viravong (Ursinus College).&#160;In conjunction with former Grinnell professor Lisa Avalos, Lesley has just begun work on a UK play about credibility in “false” rape accusations.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Library, Theatre Dance Department","Tags":["FacultyStaff Research Series"],"ID":28285},

Andre’s experience is as a “hidden child,” after his birth parents made the excruciating, but ultimately life-saving decision to ask a Christian family to take him in.\n\n\n  Andre was a Jewish 5-year-old, when he went “underground” with Johannes and Petronella Meijer in the town of Haarlem, not far from where he was born in Holland, where he hid out under a false name for the last two years of World War II. In January 1944, his parents and maternal grandparents were loaded onto a train with nearly 1,000 others, 122 of whom were children, bound for the Auschwitz concentration camp. His mother and grandparents were immediately sent to the gas chamber, while his father was forced to work in a nearby camp for around four months before he fell ill due to work conditions and was executed in August.\n\n\n  Holten survived the war, completing high school under the wing of the Meijers, who he emotionally said “elected to keep” him, before immigrating to the United States in 1956, where he earned a physics degree from the City College of New York. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, reaching the rank of captain and helping design protection for the fuel system of the attack aircraft A-10 “Warthog” Thunderbolt II, before moving to Albuquerque and eventually becoming a substitute teacher in Rio Rancho for around 22 years. Above all, Andre feels his story is one that teaches young students to practice tolerance, and about the many different sides of humanity.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Crssj, Student Affairs","Tags":["Multicultural","Religious and Spiritual"],"ID":30338},

Professor Uden will give a talk entitled “Love in a Time of Bankruptcy: Calculations in Catullus.”\n\n\n  In one of the most famous poems in Latin literature, Catullus urges his beloved Lesbia to give him a thousand kisses, then a hundred, then a thousand, then another hundred… and then tells her that they will ‘confuse the score,’ so onlookers will not know how many times they kissed. Why? Latin students learn that the verb ‘confuse the score’ (conturbabimus) is drawn from the language of accounting. But why would Catullus introduce a reference to economic calculation during a passionate address to a lover? In this lecture, I show that Catullus’ love language is shaped by a keen awareness of Rome’s economic problems in the 50s BCE – of political leaders risking it all in pursuing their ambitions and consuls teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The impulsive lover begging for kisses and the frantic politician deep in debt turns out to have more in common than may first appear.&#160;\n\n\n  All are welcome. A reception to honor Professor Uden will follow the lecture.\n","Audience":["Faculty &amp; Staff","Students"],"Org":"Classics Department","Tags":null,"ID":29706},

At a time when very few American colleges and universities had any institutional connections in China, Andrew created a multifaceted relationship that allowed Grinnell faculty to teach courses at Nanjing University, Grinnell graduates to teach English to Chinese high school students, Chinese language instructors to teach Chinese in Grinnell’s nascent East Asian language program, and Chinese scholars to reside and conduct research in Grinnell and meet with colleagues. &#160;As a result, countless students and faculty encountered Chinese history and culture for the first time, and Andrew was a tireless and charismatic proponent of the value of such exchange. He taught Chinese and Japanese history classes at the College, while also holding concurrent professorships at Nanjing University and Anhui University in the People’s Republic of China.\n\n\n  Andrew modeled the value of global education in his own pursuit of higher education, by studying abroad and in the United States. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Chinese Language and Literature at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, studied Asian History at Kyoto University (Japan), and received his Ph.D. in Asian History from Yale University. He taught at Case Western Reserve University and Skidmore College prior to coming to Grinnell. His research interests focused on the social and intellectual history of late imperial China.\n\n\n  In 2019, Lu “Maggie” Bian ’09 helped establish the Professor Andrew Hsieh Career Exploration Fund in the Center for Careers, Life, and Service, both to honor her experience as one of Andrew’s students and to assist future students in their own career explorations. At the time she noted that he had taught her East Asian history, “but beyond that he was a good advisor and mentor. I consulted with him when I was looking into study abroad programs. He helped with a letter of recommendation to graduate school. He made great contributions to the College overall. Naming the fund after him was on behalf of all the students he helped along the way.”\n\n\n  Andrew had a huge impact on so many students, faculty, administrators, and staff over his long tenure at the College, and his faculty colleagues think it is important that we recognize his legacy in a way that will speak to his contributions. As we learn more about any memorial plans or tributes, we will share that information.\n\n\n  Andrew, along with his wife Ming, helped to make Grinnell a more global and vibrant place; they also opened their home to colleagues and our many Nanjing visitors on countless occasions and were well known and are remembered for their wonderful hospitality and legendary dinners.\n\n\n  Andrew made an enduring difference in many lives and will remain a cherished member of our community through his legacy of teaching and friendship.\n\n\n  &#160;\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Development And Alumni Relations","Tags":["Alum Involvement","Reunion"],"ID":30834},

A. ‘Don’ Smith, 88, Professor Emeritus of History, died August 10, 2024, at the University of Iowa Hospitals, having recently suffered a stroke. A British historian who was a beloved mentor and teacher, he leaves a half-century legacy of service to Grinnell College, having joined the faculty in 1970, moving from his post as assistant professor at Yale University. A native of Cleveland, Tennessee, he earned a bachelor’s degree at Vanderbilt University, bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Oxford University, where he was Rhodes Scholar (with specializations in both British and French history), and a doctorate at Yale University.\n\n\n  As a faculty member in Grinnell College’s Department of History, Don offered courses in British history, and he partnered with faculty colleagues across the curriculum to team teach interdisciplinary courses, such as a celebrated course on The Enlightenment, in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2000 he was named L. F. Parker Professor of History. He considered his tutorial and his seminar on Alexis de Tocqueville, designed and taught as a senior faculty member, among the highlights of his teaching career.\n\n\n  Don’s service to the academic mission of the college was extraordinary. He was chair of the faculty from 1986-1988. His service also included multiple terms as chair of the Department of History and as a member of the Executive Council. He was on the initial faculty planning group that, under the leadership of President George Drake and Professor Andrew Hsieh, established the College’s institutional partnership with Nanjing University in China – one of the first U.S. colleges to do so. Over more than two decades, “Lao Shi Smith” taught courses and delivered lectures at Nanjing University, where he was revered by his Chinese colleagues.\n\n\n  From 1970-2001 Don was the college’s adviser for Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships. In addition to his service to the Grinnell College’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter, he served in different leadership roles – including president of Beta of Iowa. A long-time member of the Public Events Committee at the college, he – collaborating with Georgia Dentel, the college’s liaison to performing arts professionals – brought prominent classical musicians to the community. His interest in opera infused the arts programming that he championed. He was also an advocate of the architecture on the Grinnell College campus, with a keen appreciation of The Forum, even interviewing famed architect Walter Netsch who designed The Forum, as part of a recognition of the building and its legacy.\n\n\n  Don was a life-long Democrat, and his involvement in and leadership of the Poweshiek County Democratic Party extended over his decades in Grinnell. Through his work in party politics, he established friendships with Iowans from all walks of life, taking great pride in his connections to people in the small communities of Poweshiek County and his ability to traverse the back-roads of the state like an Iowa native. He was devoted to the Iowa Democratic caucuses. In the 1992 presidential election, he was a member of the Electoral College, casting his electoral vote for the Clinton/Gore ticket.\n\n\n  Don was preceded in death by his mother and father, Frances (née Higgins) and Tip Smith, as well as his brother, Gary K. Smith. He is survived by his family in Cleveland, Tennessee – sister-in-law Marguerite Smith; nieces and nephews Kent (Karen) Smith, Alan (Kelly) Smith, Leslie (Barrett) Painter and Lindsey (Thomas) Bell, along with many great nieces and nephews who adored him. His network of colleagues, former students and friends extends across the world.\n\n\n  Drop in any time, with remarks by family and friends at 3 p.m.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Development And Alumni Relations","Tags":["Alum Involvement","Reunion"],"ID":30833},

Made in collaboration with Columbia College and DePaul professors and a Northwestern PhD student, this documentary film about place is a Piscator/ Brecht/Deavere Smith-influenced montage of interviews of Evanston locals with divergent viewpoints. Interpreted by actors, seven diverse residents address issues of identity, belonging, and home in a progressive city: but one in which conversations often do not cross demographic boundaries. Issues include homelessness, racial equity and reparations, diversity and inclusivity, community policing, climate change, and immigration/displacement/remaking the self in this place.&#160; Using techniques of ethnographic (or verbatim) theatre, engaging constructions of film and theatrical “reality,” the documentary’s activism springs from the Brechtian question, “Why does it have to be this way?”&#160; It reflects on inequality, resourcefulness, and commitment as substrates for stories of individual loss, striving, and belonging—or not–in a city.&#160; This workshop version of the film encourages audiences’ active viewing and speaking up, engaging in philosopher Linda Alcoff’s “speaking with” rather than the positionality of “speaking for” or “as” in discussion.&#160; It encourages attendees to connect with stories of belonging/ unbelonging in their own locations.\n\n\n  Lesley Delmenico is an associate professor of Theatre and Performance Studies (M.A., Ph.D. Northwestern University).&#160; Her work on theatre and politics explores intersections of performance, post-coloniality, gender, and immigration, concentrating on the ways that marginalized women improvise speaking spaces in urban settings.&#160; An ethnographic/verbatim playwright and director, she has created professional and community-based performances in London, Grinnell, Evanston IL, and Mumbai. No Bad Women, adapted from a landmark British trial, was a sold-out London production in 2019.&#160; Her article, “Performing Public Presence: African Migrant Women Create&#160;Uncomfortable Conversations&#160;in London,” was featured by Cambridge University Press for International Women’s Day, 2020.&#160;&#160;Recent adaptations/directions for performance and film include More than Skin Deep,&#160;an inter-racial conversation with Prof. Jan Gross (Grinnell College) and Prof. Heather Lobban-Viravong (Ursinus College).&#160;In conjunction with former Grinnell professor Lisa Avalos, Lesley has just begun work on a UK play about credibility in “false” rape accusations.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Library, Theatre Dance Department","Tags":["FacultyStaff Research Series"],"ID":28918},
