Jill Felber and Claudia Anderson burst open the expressive possibilities of two flutes together starting in 1997, with Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Jennifer Higdon’s composition&#160;running the edgE.&#160;Jennifer’s dedication in the score, “to Jill and Claudia, always running the edge,”&#160;proved prophetic over the next 25 years. ZAWA!’s commissions, arrangements, and programs with strikingly diverse repertoire display drama, versatility and the humor the duo has become known for, all delivered with high-spirited energy and impact. Their new program includes enticing scores from composers both known and emerging, and electronic versions of pieces from earlier repertoire.&#160;\n\n\n  &#160;\n\n\n  &#160;ZAWA’s program includes Snap! &#160;for two C flutes and electronic media by Claudia’s music department colleague &#160;John Rommereim.&#160;\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Music Department","Tags":["Music"],"ID":29927},

How do microbes split the triple bond of nitrogen gas? When it comes to performing difficult chemistry, microbes often combine a protein scaffold with a highly reactive metallocofactor; they essentially employ a “hired gun.” The Drennan lab combines X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy with other biophysical methods to reveal the secrets behind metalloenzyme chemistry. In this seminar, Drennan will present her lab’s structural studies of ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). RNRs use metallocofactors to generate radical species, enabling the conversion of ribonucleotides (the building blocks of RNA) to deoxyribonucleotides (the building blocks of DNA). These enzymes are chemotherapeutic targets and proposed antibacterial targets. Here, Drennan will describe how her lab has used biophysical methods to reveal RNR’s secrets.\n\n\n  &#160;\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Students"],"Org":"Science Division","Tags":null,"ID":30469},
