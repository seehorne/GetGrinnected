Cultivations novels are a fantasy genre telling stories about how practitioners of internal alchemy achieve immortality and explore infinite worlds. The Cthulhu Mythos was first invented in America between the two world wars in the twentieth century, while cultivation novels emerged in the twenty-first century when China ascended as a global power. The two fictional universes, the former loaded with anti-humanist sentiments and the latter celebrating ultra-humanism, have converged in Cthulhu-cultivation novels and transformed one another. While both systems draw on esoteric traditions around the world and enact apocalyptic worldviews and “blasphemous” practices, the new hybrid, Cthulhu-cultivation novels, are particularly worthy of our attention because they have been experimenting with engaged nihilism, that is, a critical response to social issues, a hostility toward established power structures, and a call for radical changes.\n","Audience":["Faculty &amp; Staff","Students"],"Org":"Chinese Japanese Department, East Asian Concentration, Religious Studies","Tags":null,"ID":29820},
