For the past 14 years I’ve tried to consider all that I witnessed as a stranger in a foreign land. A Choctaw In King Abdullah’s Court, a memoir, aims to capture the humor, and often despair of being alone among a sea of indigenous peoples that only know of American Indians as cartoons, or dead heroes.”\n\n\n  LeAnne Howe is Eidson Distinguished Professor at the University of Georgia. She has published award-winning work in multiple genres spread out across a global network in which she connects literature, Indigenous knowledge, Native histories, and expressive cultures. She received her MFA from Vermont in 2000.\n\n\n  The usual constraints of time and space do not allow us to do justice to Howe’s prolific output, an output that pushes back exuberantly against the very configurations that seek to pin her to specific locations and locutions. Listing Howe’s awards alone is obviously insufficient, but doing so might give us a sense of the responsibility we readers and fellow academics share to pay proper respect to the enormity of her gifts: Howe shares a Native and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA) award for literary criticism with eleven other scholars for Reasoning Together: The Native Critics Collective, named one of the ten most influential books of the first decade of the twenty-first century for indigenous scholarship, 2011; Howe is also the recipient of a United States Artists (USA) Ford Fellowship, Lifetime Achievement Award by the Native Writers’ Circle of the Americas, and the American Book Award and Oklahoma Book Award for Shell Shaker (2001); in October 2015, Howe received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western Literature Association, and in 2014 she received the Modern Languages Association inaugural prize for Studies in Native American Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, for her short story collection, Choctalking on Other Realities; I Fuck Up in Japan, a story from the collection has been reprinted in many journals; and a special issue of Studies in American Indian Literature (2014) contains an exploration by six scholars on Howe’s literary concept of Tribalography; Howe was also a Fulbright Distinguished Scholar to Jordan, with that experience serving as the backdrop for her talk.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Scholars Convocation","Tags":["Scholars' Convocation"],"ID":29555},
