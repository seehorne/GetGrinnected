Her expertise is in the field of migration materialities, with a geographic focus on Latinx migration and border security at the US-Mexico border. This materiality includes the evidentiary regimes of forensic death investigations and searches for missing people, the infrastructure of security and humanitarian aid, as well as the manifest results of security practice that account for a vast material footprint of people and belongings lost and left behind in transit. Her first book–tentatively titled,&#160;Border Afterlives: Migrant Deaths, Forensic Investigations, and the Politics of Haunting–applies this archaeological sensibility towards postmortem investigation, forensic evidence, commemoration, and care for undocumented migrants who die during border crossings in the US southwest.&#160;It is under contract with the University of Arizona Press for a spring 2026 publication.&#160;\n    \n    \n      Gabriella’s work appears in numerous refereed journals including the&#160;Journal of Migration and Human Security,&#160;Political Geography, American Anthropologist,&#160;and the&#160;Journal of Social Archaeology.&#160;Her article, “Object Afterlives and the Burden of History: Between ‘trash’ and ‘heritage’ in the footsteps of migrants,” was awarded the American Anthropological Association Archaeology Division’s Gordon R. Willey Paper Prize in 2019. She has contributed chapters for the scholarly volumes,&#160;The New Nomadic Age: Archaeologies of Forced and Undocumented Migration&#160;and&#160;Sociopolitics of Migrant Death and Repatriation: Perspectives for Forensic Science.&#160;Gabriella also contributes to the online anthropology magazine,&#160;Sapiens.org.&#160;Her research has been funded by the Louis Foucar Marshall Foundation and the Wenner Gren Foundation, among others.\n    \n    \n      Gabriella is a research affiliate at the&#160;Binational Migration Institute&#160;and is an affiliated faculty member in ASU’s&#160;School of Transborder Studies&#160;and with the&#160;Latinx Oral History Lab. She was a 2023-2024 fellow of the&#160;&#160;American Council of Learned Societies, which facilitated for the completion of her first scholarly manuscript,&#160;Border Afterlives.&#160;\n    \n  \n\n\n  Abstract:\n\n\n  In 2023, the UN’s International Organization for Migration named the US-Mexico border as the world’s deadliest land border, where undocumented border crossing comes with deadly risk. This has been the case for decades, represented by both deaths and disappearances that collectively number in the tens of thousands in the southwestern United States alone. This talk represents an overview of my forthcoming book, Border Afterlives: Migrant Deaths, Forensic Investigations, and the Politics of Haunting. Its focus is the official and unofficial practices that happen in the aftermath of border crossing deaths. This includes investigating deaths and pursuing the difficult process of forensic identification for unknown remains often found outdoors and subject to long-term postmortem exposure. It includes counting the dead and missing and seeking accountability for the deaths that one border jurisdiction has officially resolved this year constitute the US government’s “knowingly killing immigrants.” It involves civil society’s theory of change in the face of these deaths, and the activism and scholarship with which I have been involved over nearly two decades. Though localized on the border, the book makes the case that migrant deaths expose the limitations and biases that pervade existing systems of care for the dead both nationally and internationally, provoking broader questions of what it means to seek justice on the dead’s behalf—especially as migrant transit deaths continue and border enforcement characterizes such deaths as accidental.&#160;\n","Audience":["Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Students"],"Org":"Anthropology Department","Tags":null,"ID":30436},

These traditions are found in cultures all around the world, on a diverse set of instruments, and for an equally diverse range of communicative functions.

Their members are Marcus Tenney (trumpet and saxophone), Morgan Burrs (guitar), Corey Fonville (percussion), Andrew Randazzo (bass), and DJ Harrison (keyboards).&#160;\n\n\n  Butcher Brown has released forward-thinking and expansive hybrids of jazz and hip-hop since 2013. Today, they have an apt descriptor for their songs: solar music. Drawing inspiration from every sound under the sun, the Richmond, VA band adds elements of funk, soul, and rock to their foundational mix. The result is a Southern-leaning, sometimes psychedelic fusion that feels fresh yet familiar. Simultaneously working within and defying genre conventions, Butcher Brown is a jazz festival mainstay that could tour with Tyler, the Creator as easily as Khruangbin.\n\n\n  “We get daps from the jazz cats, the rap scene, the indie scene, and everyone else,” says drummer Corey Fonville. Every Butcher Brown album, show, and improvisational leap therein stems from the synergy, vision, and inexhaustible musical curiosity of him and his bandmates: producer/multi-instrumentalist DJ Harrison; bassist/composer Andrew Randazzo; trumpeter/saxophonist/MC Marcus “Tennishu” Tenney; and guitarist Morgan Burrs.The band’s past begins in Richmond, where several members attended VCU’s jazz program, and everyone mixed in the city’s vibrant music scene. Between classes and performances at local clubs, all congregated at Harrison’s home studio: Jellowstone. Jam sessions bled into blunt-passing smoke sessions soundtracked by beat tapes from renowned Richmond producer Ohbliv, D’Angelo’s sensual, funky and forward-thinking neo-soul, and saxophonist Joe Henderson’s Power to the People. All culminated in Butcher Brown’s 2014 debut, All Purpose Music, a 76-minute jazz-driven odyssey into every genre at the band’s disposal.\n\n\n  Doors open at 6:30pm, show starts at 7:30pm.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Public Events Committee","Tags":["Community Partnership","Music","Public Events Series"],"ID":28896},

She then spent two years in the United Kingdom where she finished two master’s degrees, a Master’s in Early Modern History from the University of Cambridge and a Master’s in International Relations from the London School of Economics.\n\n\n  After completing two master’s programs back-to-back, Sydney began working at Circana (fka IRI), a big data consulting firm based in Chicago in their legal department. She was then offered a job at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. where she investigated financial crimes. Always looking for new opportunities, Sydney brought her diverse set of skills to Goldman Sachs in Salt Lake City before eventually transferring to Goldman’s Chicago offices. While she has lived and worked in more parts of the world than most people will visit in their lifetime, she still loves Iowa more than any place she’s ever been.\n\n\n  Sydney is passionate about working hard, continuously improves her knowledge and is a dedicated professional, with life experiences that rival even the most senior individuals.

{"Title":"Butcher Brown","Date":"March 27","Time":"7:30 p.m. - 9:30 p.m.","Location":"Herrick Chapel","Description":"\n  Butcher Brown is a jazz quintet founded in 2009 and&#160;based in Richmond, Virginia. Their members are Marcus Tenney (trumpet and saxophone), Morgan Burrs (guitar), Corey Fonville (percussion), Andrew Randazzo (bass), and DJ Harrison (keyboards).&#160;\n\n\n  Butcher Brown has released forward-thinking and expansive hybrids of jazz and hip-hop since 2013. Today, they have an apt descriptor for their songs: solar music. Drawing inspiration from every sound under the sun, the Richmond, VA band adds elements of funk, soul, and rock to their foundational mix. The result is a Southern-leaning, sometimes psychedelic fusion that feels fresh yet familiar. Simultaneously working within and defying genre conventions, Butcher Brown is a jazz festival mainstay that could tour with Tyler, the Creator as easily as Khruangbin.\n\n\n  “We get daps from the jazz cats, the rap scene, the indie scene, and everyone else,” says drummer Corey Fonville. Every Butcher Brown album, show, and improvisational leap therein stems from the synergy, vision, and inexhaustible musical curiosity of him and his bandmates: producer/multi-instrumentalist DJ Harrison; bassist/composer Andrew Randazzo; trumpeter/saxophonist/MC Marcus “Tennishu” Tenney; and guitarist Morgan Burrs.The band’s past begins in Richmond, where several members attended VCU’s jazz program, and everyone mixed in the city’s vibrant music scene. Between classes and performances at local clubs, all congregated at Harrison’s home studio: Jellowstone. Jam sessions bled into blunt-passing smoke sessions soundtracked by beat tapes from renowned Richmond producer Ohbliv, D’Angelo’s sensual, funky and forward-thinking neo-soul, and saxophonist Joe Henderson’s Power to the People. All culminated in Butcher Brown’s 2014 debut, All Purpose Music, a 76-minute jazz-driven odyssey into every genre at the band’s disposal.\n\n\n  Doors open at 6:30pm, show starts at 7:30pm.\n","Audience":["Alumni","Faculty &amp; Staff","General Public","Prospective Students","Student Families","Students"],"Org":"Public Events Committee","Tags":["Community Partnership","Music","Public Events Series"],"ID":28931},
