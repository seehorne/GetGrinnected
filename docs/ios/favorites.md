# Favorites

On your favorites page, you can see which events you have favorited. If you unfavorite an event, it will be automatically removed from the screen.

You can tap to expand events, the same way as on the home screen.

## Filtering and sorting

You can sort by either name or time, ascending.

If you click the "Tags" dropdown in the upper-right corner, you can select one or more tags to filter by.

- As you select more tags, events with **any of the selected tags** will be shown.
