# GetGrinnected

GetGrinnected is an iOS and Android app that provides an event calendar option for Grinnellians attending and organizing events.
Attendees can use it to find and follow events they are interested in, and organizers can use it to communicate with their communities.

It was created to TODO - WRITE MORE ABOUT REASONS HERE. I am struggling to phrase.

# In this repo

Here's what each directory in this repo is:

- `written reports` - Markdown writeups for class milestones
- `LICENSE` - MIT license for all content in the repo
- `README.md` - The file you're reading, explaining the repo

# Issue tracking

TODO - Will discuss further in class Feb 14.

# Developer guidelines

TODO - Establish these, not explicitly stated but is part of "setting up github." Leah's basic ones are:

- Make a new branch for each feature
- `main` branch is protected, don't merge in without oversight
    - TODO: If we go wit this, actually protect `main`. Perhaps specify if we require merge reqs on the web interface

# TODO: Delete this section? Seems like it will be covered by Trello

TODO FOR MILESTONE 2
* Describe idea and goals of project
