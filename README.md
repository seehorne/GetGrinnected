# GetGrinnected

GetGrinnected is an iOS and Android app that provides an event calendar option for Grinnellians attending and organizing events.
Attendees can use it to find and follow events they are interested in, and organizers can use it to communicate with their communities.

It was created to TODO - WRITE MORE ABOUT REASONS HERE. I am struggling to phrase.
