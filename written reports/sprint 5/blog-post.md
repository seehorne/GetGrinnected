# NOT PART OF TEXT: CATEGORIES

Everything below and including the "GetGrinnected" header is the actual text of the blog post, but categories are part of the metadata rather than the text.

These are the categories of our post:

- Calendar
- Events
- Grinnell College
- Planning

If other groups also choose to create a "Spring 2025" category we would also like to be included under that tag. However, it seems like that organization is not consistent across past blog posts, and we wouldn't want to contribute further to that inconsistency.

# Overview

GetGrinnected is an app designed to give Grinnell students an easy way to find and attend events around campus.

TODO: SUMMARIZE THE REST OF THE POST BUT LIKE REALLY QUICKLY, THIS SHOULD BE SO EASY TO READ.

# Motivation

For those unfamiliar with the Midwest, arriving in the middle of Iowa as a first-year student is no easy task. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a year of connection between class years and the passage of institutional memory and campus culture has suffered. Many students feel underwhelmed by the activities to do, or are disappointed by the classes, and are unable to find the resources or groups on campus to lift them up. In fact, about 47% of Grinnellians at one point considered transferring or withdrawing from Grinnell College [1]. Although there are more than one hundred Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) in Grinnell, the infrastructure to reach those RSOs is lacking, if not non-existent. Only once per semester do RSOs participate in the Organization Fair. As such, GetGrinnected was born, with the vision to create an easily accessible and intuitive application for students to stay updated about on-campus events. We hope this app fosters community engagement on a scale that Grinnell hasn't seen before and cultivates a feeling of belonging. 

# Product

GetGrinnected is a native app for iOS and Android. It reads publicly-available event information from the college and

# Process

After establishing our idea for GetGrinnected, we began constructing a paper prototype! Divvying up pages and processes to different team members, and that's when the vision really started to come together. From sticky notes to heavy-duty construction paper, we used it all to bring our app to life.

Then it was time to show it off to stakeholders. We set meetings and dates with fellow Grinnellians who took time out of their days to help us refine our vision. Their feedback was crucial, especially so early on in our development process when we were still trying to build our mental model of the app.

With their feedback, we made it to the next development step, PLANNING, PLANNING, PLANNING. We had a lot of the what UI and mentally figured out, but that was only the first piece of the puzzle; we lacked the who, where, why, and how. Who was going to implement each component? Where were we going to host it? Store data? Why is each feature important? How are we going to do this? This led us to diagramming our database, fleshing out use cases, and setting a defined list of requirements for our product.

After planning, it was time to put the preparation into action and begin implementation. This was bumpy and definitely where we learned a lot about what goes into software development. But between clear communication via Discord and in-person group meetings, we made forward progress!

However, about halfway through development, we hit one of our largest challenges! Our ambition! While being excited and passionate about the project was important, it had caused us to vastly overestimate the scope of what we could accomplish in a semester as new software developers. Thus, we had a crucial group meeting where we came back to the requirements we had set and discussed what was really necessary. What made our app our app? This meeting allowed us to reframe our objectives and hone in on the highest-impact features. The choice to make these shifts was a pivotal step in our learning.

Upon adjusting our aims, we spent many weeks implementing features, API calls, testing, etc. With implementation came the oh so dreaded merge conflicts. These were inevitable challenges that afflict most who utilize version control for larger projects. However, we learned that by clearly communicating the section of a project we would be working on and the progress we were making, it allowed us to mitigate these conflicts. While we couldn’t entirely avoid these conflicts, we managed to decrease the frequency at which we ran into them while maintaining parallel development across sub-teams.

During our implementation, we had the opportunity to meet with our previous stakeholders from the prototype period, who could test our actual application. They offered us vital feedback, and it was actually at this point that we contacted Rei about logo design and settled on a color scheme for the app! 

From then on, it was group meetings, Discord updates, and presentations, all while steadily chipping away at the vision we had laid out 14 weeks prior. And finally, here, as we are writing this blog post for you, we are getting the beta version of our app out into the hands of Grinnellians! While we had challenges, highs and lows, and many all-nighters during this process, we truly were able to gain an understanding of what it takes and what goes into seeing an app through from a mental model to an application with a user base!

# Advice

If there was any advice we could offer future CSC-324 students, it would be this. Pick a project that you are truly passionate about, something you need, a friend needs, something that truly motivates you. And then communicate early and often with your teammates about any successes and challenges you experience. It is going to be challenging, and there are going to be points when you feel lost in the development, but know that this is normal and you will figure it out, and that this is a perfect time to talk to your teammates about how you’re feeling. In the end, have a blast and take a second to reflect on just how much you have learned and take pride in the vision you brought to life!

# Acknowledgements

We are deeply grateful to the amazing individuals who helped bring GetGrinnected to life. We would like to thank Rei Yamada, who contributed her expertise in designing our logo and app icon! We extend our appreciation to Yuina Iseki, Lily Freeman, and Regan Stambaugh, who served as testers and stakeholders in our project, offering crucial feedback throughout the development process. Our CSC-324 course mentor, Destany Best, participated in various team meetings and provided valuable support, feedback, and her perspective as a former student of the course. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to our CSC-324 instructor, Prof. Leah Perlmutter, who guided us through software development as a topic, allowed us the freedom to explore and grow as students, and encouraged us to truly push our skills as computer scientists.
