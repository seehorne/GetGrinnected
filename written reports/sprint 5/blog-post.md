# NOT PART OF TEXT: CATEGORIES

Everything below and including the "GetGrinnected" header is the actual text of the blog post, but categories are part of the metadata rather than the text.

These are the categories of our post:

- Calendar
- Events
- Grinnell College
- Planning

If other groups also choose to create a "Spring 2025" category we would also like to be included under that tag. However, it seems like that organization is not consistent across past blog posts, and we wouldn't want to contribute further to that inconsistency.

# Overview

GetGrinnected is an app designed to give Grinnell students an easy way to find and attend events around campus.

TODO: SUMMARIZE THE REST OF THE POST BUT LIKE REALLY QUICKLY, THIS SHOULD BE SO EASY TO READ.

# Motivation

For those unfamiliar with the Midwest, arriving in the middle of Iowa as a first-year student is no easy task. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a year of connection between class years and the passage of institutional memory and campus culture has suffered. Many students feel underwhelmed by the activities to do, or are disappointed by the classes, and are unable to find the resources or groups on campus to lift them up. In fact, about 47% of Grinnellians at one point considered transferring or withdrawing from Grinnell College [1]. Although there are more than one hundred Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) in Grinnell, the infrastructure to reach those RSOs is lacking, if not non-existent. Only once per semester do RSOs participate in the Organization Fair. As such, GetGrinnected was born, with the vision to create an easily accessible and intuitive application for students to stay updated about on-campus events. We hope this app fosters community engagement on a scale that Grinnell hasn't seen before and cultivates a feeling of belonging. 

# Product

GetGrinnected is a native app for iOS and Android. It reads publicly-available event information from the college and

# Process

After establishing our idea for GetGrinnected, we began constructing a paper prototype! Divvying up pages and processes to different team members, and that's when the vision really started to come together. From sticky notes to heavy-duty construction paper, we used it all to bring our app to life.

Then it was time to show it off to stakeholders. We set meetings and dates with fellow Grinnellians who took time out of their days to help us refine our vision. Their feedback was crucial, especially so early on in our development process when we were still trying to build our mental model of the app.

With their feedback, we made it to the next development step, PLANNING, PLANNING, PLANNING. We had a lot of the what UI and mentally figured out, but that was only the first piece of the puzzle; we lacked the who, where, why, and how. Who was going to implement each component? Where were we going to host it? Store data? Why is each feature important? How are we going to do this? This led us to diagramming our database, fleshing out use cases, and setting a defined list of requirements for our product.

After planning, it was time to put the preparation into action and begin implementation. This was bumpy and definitely where we learned a lot about what goes into software development. We utilized Discord
