# Sprint 5 planning

## Capacity

We have decided to give our capacities in both beans (for us, for fun) and in hours (for turnin requirements).

Beans mean nothing except how free or overloaded these next two weeks, and hours are our best attempt to figure out how much time we'll be able to dedicate towards the project this sprint.
