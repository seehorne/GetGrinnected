# Sprint 5 planning

## Capacity

We have decided to give our capacities in both beans (for us, for fun) and in hours (for turnin requirements).

Beans mean vibes, but hours mean how much time we can/are willing to dedicate. They are not correlated.

### Michael: 3/5 beans, 10-12 hr outside class prob maybe more

- Art project to finish  
- Research paper final draft and presentation next week  
- Other final project I should probably start on

### almond: 2/5 beans, 42 hours

- Lots is due soon in other classes, they need some attention but I’ve been balancing that all along and it shouldn’t be TOO much more attention.  
- Willing to do what is needed for this sprint.  
- Because of that, this time estimate is based on the combined total of all estimates assigned to me.

### Ethan: 2/5 beans, 14.5-16.5 hrs

- Other stuff to do  
- Classes besides this need to come off the back burner  
- Try to get deliverables in by Reading Day if we can?

### Ellie: 2.5-3/5 beans (32.25 hours)

- Lots of other final things.  
- Various business to get done but this class will get it done  
- Finals week right around the due date of the sprint very tied up, free right before, right after.

### Budhil: 1.5-2.5/5 beans

- Yesterday was disappointing, might feel better today or tomorrow.  
- Assignments for other classes of course. Bunch of dirty work.

### Anthony: 2-3/5 beans, 35 hours.

- Getting very tired.

## Goals

Our development goal this sprint is to finish the product.

In this area, give estimates for how long each item will take.
