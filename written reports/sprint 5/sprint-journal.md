# (1) Adoption Plan

## 1.

## 2.
Current State
- Working Login and account creation using email verification
- Sortable home-page in both IOS and Android
- Can favorite upcoming events
- Working settings page with adjustable text size and dark mode
- Most accessibility metrics met 
- Kotlin does not form to every phone sizing sometimes cutting text off
- Search feature in progress on Kotlin
- Notifications only work in app in Kotlin
- Search Feature in Progress in Swift
- Authorization in progress on swift
- Screen Reader accessibility partially implemented. 
### Benefits 
- Helps advertise grinnell events to students so everyone can know what is happening on campus
- Especially helpful for new students who don't know grinnell to find things to do to build community.
### Risks
- App might crash with bugs we have not experienced
- Text might not be visible on all phone versions as it wraps to certain sizes.
- The app might not be fully accessible to everyone as certain accessibility features are still in progress.
  
I think our current state is reasonable to start deploying to users. It has defects and missing features that make it incomplete but what is present makes for a useful app that can have real benefits to the Grinnell community. We plan to continue development slightly to try and get the feature we want included in the product but it is worthwhile to get our product in peoples hands before the end of the semester. 
## 3. A
We would like our app to be on 80% of the Grinnell students populations phones (1420 users). We don't want them using it very often for most users once a week and some once a day. We would like usage of our app to decline over the semester as people find organizations and activities to participate in weekly but expect some usage to check for gardners, talks and other one time events. 

To get students aware of the product we want to use a combination of posters, tabling, club emails and word of mouth. For early adoption we will use posters spread around campus with links to download the app, at least the beta version. We hope to table in front of Dhal to promote the app as well, engaging people to get the links and try the app. Additionally we plan to engage student organizations we are involved in or are friends with to send emails encouraging adoption. Finally we hope that next semester when we are gone we will get it to spread through word of mouth to the first year class. 

To make continual adoption as easy as possible we plan to publish the app to the google play and apple app store respectfully so that any student on campus can download them. This should make continued use easy for students who only need to know it exists and find it on their phone. 

Despite moving towards adoption we do plan to complete the work on our product. Finishing any features that are necessary and incomplete by the end of the semester. Examples might end up including timed notifications and search features for kotlin and notifications for swift. We think our current product is worthy of publishing but understand where it could be better.
