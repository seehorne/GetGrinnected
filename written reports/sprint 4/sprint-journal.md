# (1) External Documentation and Stakeholder Meetings

## Stakeholder: Regan

We met with Regan Stambaugh on Wednesday April 23rd at 6:30pm. Regan is a student athlete, upcoming team captain, SEPC leader, Singer and Rising 4th year Grinnell College student.

### Feedback

#### Description of Test Session

We treated the test session similarly to the prototype sessions where we followed a sandbox approach but this time with the docs as the supplementary material to communicate steps. Generally, Regan did not use the docs and we only provided a few nudges in certain directions for features not fully implemented (for example: verification code at the time was hard coded to 123456 so we let her know that). We showed her iOS first, then Android.

#### Behavoir of interacting with the documentation

As mentioned previously she didn't really use the documentation much at all as it seemed the app was pretty intuitive. We left it on a laptop beside her to reference at any time but generally she was able to deduce where and how to do actions within the app (And with our feedback on when a feature wasn't fully implemented it made it pretty clear where the limitations at the time of the app were to her).

#### Did they succeed or get stuck?

As mentioned previously she was very successful in navigating our app aside from not entirely intuitive points (ie a not fully implemented feature) she pretty well found all of the features or tried all of the features of the app with little to know prompting.

#### What feedback did they provide about documentation?

She didn't really provide feedback on documentation given that she didn't really utilize it. However from the general look over the documentation she didn't seem to be confused or off put by any section in particular.

#### What questions did we ask and what were Regan's answers?

* Which of the two color schemes did you prefer?
  * Response: iOS
* What information would you expect to see on an org card?
  * Response: What is there seems comprehensive enough.
* Where would you expect the followed org cards to be?
  * Response: Not in settings. Maybe settings is profile or org cards are in favorite screen.
* What would you expect a search bar to do?
  * Response: Search all days for events that match the search.

#### General Notes from meeting

iOS
* Login
  * Guess I should make an account
* Home
  * Liked the calendar view for different days on home page
  * Liked favoriting other events
  * “This is exciting”
  * Runs a little slow
  * Needs to sort by tags
  * Fun to see events they were not aware of
* Calendar
  * Calendar feature is cool
  * The calendar design is sleeker
  * Why can I sort by date on home screen (isn’t different enough)
* Favorites
  * No comments
* Settings
  * Dark Mode
  * Thought logo would log out
* General
  * Would I be able to add events as an org leader?
    * Response: Probably only allowing updates
  * Color scheme looks good
  * I like that is all there
  * I like that its all in one place 

ANDROID
* Login
  * Went to her phone to check for email so very intuitve where the verification code would go
* Home
  * Date was unclear as to what day it was talking about (is the 25th Sunday)
  * Was not clear how tags were working
  * No women’s sports on this day
* Calendar
  * Cool how clicking on a day pulls up events
  * Filters carry over 
  * Confusing that it doesn't update until new day is clicked 
* Favorites
  * No comments
* Settings
  * Org cards seem comprehensive enough
  * Maybe calling it profile would be better 
  * Would then make sense for orgs to be there 
  * Orgs could also go on favorites
  * Switch account button not clear
* General
  * How do I find orgs 
  * Can I click on org names to go to org
  * Is there a search bar? 
  * What should have search bars
    * Home page should at least have search bar
  * Is the verification code going to be a permanent feature
  * “Nice job. It looks nice”

#### What we will change based on this feedback

* We truly affirmed that we will be switching the color scheme for Android to match the blue theme we currently have on iOS
* Again as our other stakeholders had mentioned, it further establishes a need for a functioning search bar as a pivotal feature of our app.
* Along with our other stakeholder meetings it was pointed out that the calendar didn't seem distinct/different enough from the homepage so we may decide on moving forward without the calendar page in exchange for a super effective search feature.

## Stakeholder: Lily

We met with Lily Freeman on Tuesday April 22 and 4:30pm. Lily is a second year student who is not in formal leadership of any organization. She lives in a project house and is a member of the women's ultimate frisbee team.
### Feedback
#### Description of Test Session
We treated the test session similarly to the prototype sessions where we followed a sandbox approach but this time with the docs as the supplementary material to communicate steps. Generally, Lily did not use the docs, though she did take a brief look when they were provided to her, and we only provided a few nudges in certain directions for features not fully implemented (for example: verification code at the time was hard coded to 123456 so we let her know that). We showed her Android first then iOS.

#### Behavoir of interacting with the documentation
After being shown them, Lily did not interact with the documentation especially heavily during the sessions itself. However, she also had very few questions about how things worked, and the interactions she tried in our sandbox protocol nearly always did what she expected (which aligned with what we intended them to do). The one exception to this rule would be when a feature wasn't implemented, which, as we did in interviews, we would let her know was the case (this was denoted in the documentation as well, but wouldn't have given much more context than us talking).

#### Did they succeed or get stuck
As mentioned in the documentation part, she largely succeeded! She found pretty much every feature on both the Android and iOS side with little or no prompting: the one exception would be that after the Android app (which she saw first), she expected some implemented features iOS did not have yet (like favorites going to the favorite screen) because they were present on Android, but clarifying iOS did not have them yet seemed to ameliorate her confusion. 

#### What feedback did they provide about the documentation
Seeing as her use of the documentation was minimal, she didn't provide much feedback about it, but the brief look she took at it did not elicit any strong reactions—it seemed to make enough sense but not really inspire further discussion from her side.

#### What questions did we ask and what were Lily's answers

* Color scheme: what color would you imagine this being?
   * Lily's answer: probably blue, or like teal. Purple could also be nice, but lands on blue

* Logo: Do you prefer the new one (designed by Rei) or the old one (the two Gs designed by Michael early on)
   * Lily's answer: likes the new one much better

* How do you feel about passwords vs a code sent to email?
   * Lily's answer: wouldn't personally mind a password, she could always remind it or save it on her phone, but a one time code could be convenient for something like this where you aren't logging in and out all the time

* Do you have any feedback for us, positive or negative?
   * Lily's answer: Generally, had mostly positive things to say. Liked the idea of event notifications a lot to remember events and when they start, feels like that would be a lot more efficient than her current strategy of taking pictures of photos on HSSC bulletin boards but then never looking at them.

* What is a feature we don't yet have that you would like to see?
   * Lily's answer: It would be really nice if events could have images

#### General notes
ANDROID

* Login  
  * Could be clearer that it needs to be a Grinnell email  
  * Went to her phone to check email, so that process seems clear  
* Home  
  * Day filtering intuitive  
    * Does look like tomorrow though  
  * Tags make sense  
* Calendar  
  * Sorting there too  
  * Month view  
    * Wants to go to next month, feature?  
* Favorites  
  * Will it know about recurring events?  
    * It should  
*  Settings

    * What info  
      * How to contact them  
      * Their instagram if they have one  
* Wants to know if she’s seen everything?  
  * Not yet light and dark mode  
  * Tries light and dark mode  
    * “I like that a lot”  
* Feedback  
  * Like the navbar, that’s clear  
  * Likes tags a lot  
  * Expected expand to show just one, but likes that you can see more than one  
  * Expected calendar to have multiple months  
  * Colors?  
    * Android purple nice but she also just likes purple  
    * Dark mode purple pleasant to look at  
      * Red and black would feel “too Grinnell”  
      * Maybe don’t have purple AND red

iOS

* Don’t have an account link found  
  * Name, email, password thing found  
    * Password   
      * Should I remember it?  
    * OTP vs password pref?  
      * She doesn’t mind having a password bc it could saved in her phone, but some people might prefer OTP  
* Home  
  * Finds notification bell, immediately has a sense for what that does  
    * When would it notify you  
      * Customize alert time?  
        * Likes being able to customize  
      * Likes idea of getting an update when event changes  
  * Oops wrong version, tech break  
  * Overall impression?  
    * Round boxes more pleasant to look at than android ones  
  * Search bar  
    * “Oh I remember there was a lecture at the art museum but I don’t remember when it was, let me search lecture art museum”  
      * See a poster, remember some but not all  
      * Hopefully it would go across all fields so we can find it without relying on just one specific detail being forgot  
      * Search bar is a high utility feature
  * Calendar  
    * Can see super in advance  
      * Likes that you can see exact day from month view  
    * Day button that goes back to today on calendar view  
      * Liked that  
  * Settings  
    * light mode dark mode  
      * Prefers light mode, for ios, but dark mode more on android  
      * Likes that it isn’t bright red, more subdued  
      * If not red, what color would imagine it  
        * Blue, but is actively looking at WGMC photo  
        * Purple, like from android  
        * Maybe just an accent color in addition to the pink?  
        * Likes idea of us having our own color that isn’t red  
        * If had to choose: teal, blue, purple  
  * Alternative logo  
    * Likes new logo, much more than current one  
  * Generally feels very positive, likes the notification idea a lot, bc current strategy of taking pictures of event posters and then not going  
  * A feature we don’t have that would be useful  
    * Pictures of events?

   #### What we will change based on this feedback
   * This feedback, in combination with Yuina's helped us decide to use the logo made by the person who made Grinneats logo, since this logo was preferred
   * Similarly, it helped us select a new color scheme, specifically blue
   * It affirmed the utility of a search bar feature, which we are now considering directing energy that previously would've gone to calendar towards.
   * Images remain a stretch goal, but something we are actively considering doing if the time and space to implement them emerges

## Stakeholder: Yuina
We met with, Yuina Iseki on Tuesday April 22rd at 1:30pm. Yuina is a current fourth year, an international student, and the current president of ISO (International Students Organization), which is an MLC (multicultural leadership council) organization.

### Feedback

#### Description of Test Session
We treated the test session similarly to the prototype sessions where we followed a sandbox approach but this time with the docs as the supplementary material to communicate steps. Generally, Yuina did not use the docs and we only provided a few nudges in certain directions for features not fully implemented (for example: verification code at the time was hard coded to 123456 so we let her know that). We showed her iOS first, then Android.

#### Behavoir of interacting with the documentation
The documentation was available to her to the entire time on a laptop, but like our other participants, she did not interact very heavily with it. 

#### Did they succeed or get stuck
Yuina's interactions with the app were largely successful. She had some questions like "is this just for this day" in sorting by time, but she tended to answer them for herself without much of our assistance within seconds, generally by clicking on a relevant menu. The most confusion she had was in interacting with features that were not yet implemented, which we explained to her. This was also listed in the documentation, but she didn't gravitate towards that for these clarifications. We are getting the sense that external docs of that form are not super common for mobile apps, where navigating to docs mean you typically can't see the docs anymore: perhaps this is why all of our stakeholders had basically the same reaction to our docs.

#### What feedback did they provide about the documentation
On account of not really interacting with the documentation, we did not get explicit verbal feedback from Yuina about the documentation. However, she also did not experience difficulty getting the app to do what she wanted, and most of her interactions aligned with both her and our expectations (except for some things not-yet-implemented that did not perform an action because they weren't yet implemented, and that was managed through our letting her know that was the case). This functions as implicit feedback that the app itself is largely self documented in the sense that it is straightforward to use.

#### What questions did we ask and what were Yuina's answers?
* What color scheme would be a good fit?
   * Yuina's answer: blue

* What logo would be better than the current one (by which we meant our original)? (bc she independently expressed not liking the original logo at ALL)
   * Yuina's answer: something like the Grinneats one

* If you could search, what would you search for in the search bar?
   * Yuina's answer: CS events, or event types that aren't in the tags

* What features would you like to see that we don't currently have? (stretch-goal type)
   * Yuina's answer: Event recommendation algorithm, sharing events to others

#### General notes
IOS

* Logo  
* **Add GetGrinnected as a name of the app**  
* Wanted something cuter, like Grinneats  
* Squirrel holding calendar  
* Login navigation  
* Recognizes that she doesn’t have account  
* Clicks link to make one  
* Fills in username with her name  
* Fills in email with Grinnell email  
* Enters password  
  * Encounters needs to be at least 8 characters  
  * Updates password to meet that  
* Now on home  
  * Recognizes what the bell button would probably do  
  * Scrolling through events  
    * “Nice that mentor sessions are here”  
  * “Is this page just for today?”  
  * Looks at date picker  
    * Is this supposed to change the events  
    * Yes, but not currently doing so  
  * Likes the filters (tags)  
    * Track and field has weird HTML rendering of &  
  * Does the search bar work  
    * No  
    * But what would you want to do with it  
      * Search for CS study breaks  
      * Just put in CS  
        * Would find CS related events  
          * Study breaks  
          * CS table  
          * There is no tag (filter) for CS  
* Move to calendar  
  * “Is this supposed to be a calendar but it isn’t there yet”  
    * Seeing the week at the top isn’t super obvious  
    * Was expecting an actual calendar with events on each day  
* Move to settings  
  * Sees light and dark mode, toggles that on and off a couple times  
  * Tries to change username, it doesn’t really stick  
* Guided by Budhil to go back to calendar  
  * Swipe left and right on days  
* What’s the difference between home and calendar  
  * Mostly just the days  
  * What would you expect  
    * Events in different visual format  
    * List makes sense in home, but calendar different  
    * Or maybe it would be a list based off her favorites  
      * Events or orgs  
* Things she likes  
  * Favorites, notifications, UI  
  * Text and headings are nice  
  * Likes expandable event card  
    * Sees everything she expects when it expands  
    * Tag format makes sense, aligns with expectations

Android

* Login/Signup  
  * Change the logo\!  
* Verification code:  
  * 123456 (hardcoded)  
* Home page:  
  * “Wow this is very different”  
  * “Color palette is also different”  
  * ***Can I filter by location, or no?***  
  * Filter by tags and by day  
  * Is there an “all” tag?  
  * Deselect all checkboxes   
  * It doesn’t select it when I click the bar? You have to select specifically the checkbox instead of the whole line when selecting the tags  
  * There are also current double events  
  * Date view that brings a calendar is helpful, when selects a day  
* Calendar view  
  * Calendar to see day view, month view, and week view  
  * **Showing all dates from 20th of other months, other than just april**  
  * How do you feel about this page overall?  
    * If you see a calendar, and at a glance you see what kind of what events there are?  
    * Week view would make most sense. For space consideration  
    * No expectation for horizontal view, maybe would be nice  
    * Currently no switching between months	  
  * Month view:  
    *  Something, even a color code, to see what may be going on  
    * A number for number of events  
    * If you do a tag for CS, it would show a different color for the days that have a CS on that event it would be green  
    * Looks more similar to what I expected  
* Favorites:  
  * Favorites updates, its a good page, like the page.   
* Overall color scheme:  
  * It’s nice to have a color palette: consistent and aesthetic color theme  
  * Blue?  
* Settings page:  
  * Switching accounts, very nice  
  * Orgs:  
    * Like the look for orgs cards  
    * The location of settings would be expected to be in favorites not in settings  
    * Maybe a tab for events and orgs, instead of just a “favorites tab”  
    * Star for favorite orgs, heart works find

Overall impressions

* Change the logo pls  
  * Squirrel  
* Features are very nice,  
  * Filtering system  
  * Notifications  
  * Favorites  
* Other event apps:  
  * What’s different here?  
  * How can it be successful in the community  
* How important do you think the search bar for the ?  
  * Very important\! Please make it work 🙂  
  * If there are orgs you know, I would know I would be looking for CS events.   
* Stretch:  
  * If there are algorithm to suggest events you may like based on favorites  
  * See people you follow to go to   
* Sharing an event to another person.   
  * Use in instagram.  

#### What did we change in response
* Yuina's feedback about the logo prompted us to contact Rei about getting a new one, which we are now using.
* Her feedback also emphasized that search bar was very important, and that the calendar, when it doesn't look like a calendar, feels really similar to a homepage. This influenced our choice to redirect our energies towards a more robust search,

# (2) Internal Documentation Lab

## Group Anthony and Michael

### A: Anthony B: Michael

We worked on the login process code for Kotlin.

We made no code changes but furthered documentation. We added inline comments above the async functions in the AuthModel file. We added documentation to the Login Screen file specifically to explain which chunks corresponded to which UI elements and what all they did (specifically useful for the login button). Added inline comments to specific branching/conditionals that may be confusing when not knowing what is being evaluated.

The function headers and data class headers were helpful in understanding what each data class was used for or what a function did specifically. 

Hash of commit [2d3da7a](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/commit/2d3da7a58e94008b983e033657d2b8fefc0dc63b)

Our issue tracker was up to date on what the next step entailed.

### A: Michael B: Anthony

We worked on the homepage for Swift.

We made no code changes but furthered documentation. We added a header comment to the enum class for tags. We added a header comment to the home screen discussing what each UI option did so that it was easy to discern what they were used for.

The in line comments for the homescreen were helpful specifically for which brackets closed which statements. Additionally the comments on the specific values of the variables.

Hash of commit [b679543](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/commit/b679543f27ed9e8f232e589c698d09ed25adbddc)

## Group Budhil and almond

### A: almond B: Budhil

We looked at `src/backend/api.js`, lines 118 through 225 (functions `getEventsBetween`, `parseParamDate`, and `parseQueryTags`).

We agreed that, although there were already comments on many relevant parts of the code, these comments tended not to be helpful from an external perspective. Because of that, we decided they should be modified to better explain themselves to a reader who is less familiar with the code. To summarize, a lot of documentation needed to answer the question "where does this variable come from?" or "What does that function call do in the scope of the whole thing?"

Existing documentation did a decent job of saying what each thing did in most cases, but lacked enough depth to be easily understood. 

For this one, we made changes across more than one commit so I can't give you a hash. However, I can give you a link to the PR page that shows
exactly what was changed based on this lab: <https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/pull/64/files>

> If you *really* want a commit hash, most changes are part of commit [ac70e9d](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/commit/ac70e9dd6d85291ea54f5c202a1b3a6b3eb28f89).

### A: Budhil B: almond

We looked at the way the event cards were defined for Swift. We didn't look at specific lines, more jumping around to different parts of the code as we needed to in order to understand what was going on.

In this case, a lot of the documentation changes we made were to add new information where there had previously been no comments. Budhil brought up that this was something Michael had wanted when reviewing code as well. In particular, we wrote documentation centering around the questions of "Why does this struct have to have these items in it?" and "There's a lot going on here, how can I understand it overall?"

There wasn't much previous documentation that could help us in this case.

You can see our changes at the commit with hash [695e0af](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/pull/62/commits/695e0affb3f11506795e6bde4454b452f7f8c2c7).

## Group Ellie and Ethan

### A: Ethan B: Ellie
MainActivity.kt, lines 41-186

We worked together to make sure both of us had an understanding of the current code, how it works and what it was struggling with. The code previously had no documentation so I added basic function documentation. I also added some comments on specific lines to describe what they do to properly understand the function at a deeper level. 

 You can see our changes at the commit with the hash [b0d3ca9](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/commit/b0d3ca92759449de424f9ef4d40c14623d970d83)

### A: Ellie B: Ethan

On the other side, for Ellie showing code to Ethan, we worked with the functions dropPastEvents and findID, both in scrape.js. The changes we made to the documentation were to add overarching function documentation for findID and update the overarching function documentation for dropPastEvents to include the time_based parameter that was added in the most recent commit about this code prior to this lab: this was necessary if Ethan were to take over the next step of writing CI tests for it so he would know how to call things. There was already some overarching documentation for the dropPastEvents which outlined parameters except for the time_based one, as well as inline comments on both functions explaining what certain lines did, which Ethan found helpful in understanding the general behavior of the function. We also made a Trello task for the CI tests, which doesn’t have a before pic because it didn’t exist before, the after image is shown here.

<img src="images/CI_task.jpeg" width="50%">

The changes are at the commit with hash [009e931](https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/commit/009e9315376b8346ba5f1883898fc59831bf36d7)

# (3) Self-Selected Work toward Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Our minimum viable product, as described in milestone 1, is different from our current conception of minimum viable product. At the time, it included...

* Shows all events currently happening at Grinnell (scraping information off of 25 live)  
* Create a user account (Grinnell emails only?)  
* Allows users to sign up for student organization email lists  
* Student Org leaders being able to create events directly on the app  
* Allow user accounts to friend each other  
* Events sorted by category 

On April 8, we changed our MVP description to match with this better.

- Shows all events currently happening at Grinnell (scraping information off of 25 live)
- Create a user account (Grinnell emails only?)
  - Sign in:
    - Ask for username and password
    - Forgot password option
    - Forgot username option
  - sign up:
    - Power-account vs normal user account distinction (how will this work?)
      - Verify the authority to ensure security and privacy
    - Ask for grinnell email
    - Ask for create-password
      - List requirements for password
      - If requirements are not met, shows that it's not met
    - Verify email with verification
      - Send email to email automatically, with a code that is available for a 60 second time limit
- Events sorted by category
- Users can search for events on Home page and in calendar
  - "robust" searching, to include misspellings and find tags that were incorrectly inputted
  - events and organizations show up when search
  - when no search found, "no results" pop-up, prompting user to reduce filters or change search
  - speech-to-text option
- Event cards
  - Found on Home Page + Calendar
  - contains information on:
    - if event repeats
    - if RSVP, max headcount and current number
    - how many people liked events
    - tags
    - description
    - organizations and collaborating organizations
  - able to see **organization** and follow organizations
- Bottom bar for easy navigation between windows
- Highlights window you are on in bottom bar
- Email verification for profile creation 
- Color system chosen to be accesable to color blindness with options for different types of color blindness

  - Can change the day to look at any point in the next week
  - Can change the tags to sort events you are viewing
  - Includes navigation bar to calendar and profile page
  - A sort button to sort based on popularity, alphabetically, by organization (grouping organizations)

  - Ability to see drafted event in calendar
  - Ability to toggle between public calendar and personal (liked events + drafts) calendar
  - Ability to click on a specific day, to get the day of an event, and able to click on a specific event to get the **event card** associated with that event
  - Ability to filter events
  - Includes navigation bar to home and profile page
- Profile page
  - Able to change profile picture
  - Able to change username (to reasonable names)
  - Able to change account to other organization accounts a user has
  - Able to sign out of current account
  - Contains list of followed organizations:
    - if no organizations to be found, "FIND organizations" button
  - Include settings page:
    - change text-size for the application
    - light-dark/other colored themes, for better visibility
  - Organizations list
    - sort organizations by popularity, alphabet, etc. 
    - able to see **organization card** through organization list
    - able to follow an organization through **organization card**
    - able to see the events an organization is hosting
    - to see an organizations' events through the organizations list
    - to  follow an organization, will it be a request-to-follow feature? How do we deal with exclusivity(?)
  - Followed organization list
    - able to see organizations' page/user pages(?)
  - Social aspect: to be spoken about after the sprint
    - collaborations with organizations

However, there are still things that have changed to date. Some of these have been changed due to us getting a better understanding of the design and usage parameters of our app, and others are to make sure we are still able to deliver a realized product within the semester. Here, we list the differences from that description of our MVP.

- We now use one-time verification codes, so no need for passwords.
- We decided to put less focus on checking if events from 25live had certain features, because we evaluated them to be more trouble than they are worth with the way the system stores information.
  - Repetition: Can't check for it properly, all events have different IDs even when repeated.
  - RSVP: scrape public events only, so it won't be a problem to check
- Draft events are no longer relevant since we do not plan to allow posting of events in the MVP
- Based on user feedback, we have decided to lessen the importance of the calendar and focus on the homepage and search features.
- We are taking away focus from org cards and listings, since they do not fit as well in this version of the app and we are not confident in our ability to deliver them well-made and on-time.

As a whole, the vast majority of these goals apart from those outlined has been completed. The things that remain are:

* Accessibility settings
   * We have the one color scheme (or two, if you consider dark and light mode), but are taking efforts to ensure that one scheme is colorblind accessible, since there are fewer options. Having one main scheme is important to visual identity which has motivated this choice
   * Variable text size has yet to be implemented but we will in the coming sprint
* Profile picture
   * With the declining importance of social features, these are less salient.
   * However, if it is to remain in the MVP, this would require an implementation of image hosting. 
* Sorting by popularity
   * This would require live updates of who has favorited what, which could be managed on a database level through API calls.
* Searching
   * Well underway on both frontends but not yet robust
      * The ability to quickly and robustly sort the events based on user input
      * Can search by any text in an event item
       * Search By event title
       * Search By event description
       * Search By orgs associated with events
       * Search By tags associated with event
       * Search By location associated with event
       * Search by favorite event
       * Can Mix and match any of those search conditionals to find intended events by user in our database
* Frontends syncing their user data with the database

While these have room for growth and for re-evaluation of place in the MVP, the rest of listed items are complete, leaving us well, well on our way to a minimum usable and deployable system

# (4) **Generative AI** Experiment

Each experiment will be an h2 (`##`) below, with individual questions under h3s (`###`). 

## Exploring Authorization Possibilities

This was done by almond on their own.

### What were initial goals and expectations?

Written before starting the experiment.

I have been overwhelmed by how many options there are for implementing authorization, and the articles that talk about it are unhelpful because they are AI-generated and don't answer the questions I actually have.

I want to find out a good option for us to use in our software, based on our needs. I will figure out what needs are relevant by asking the AI.

Then, I want to be shown an example of what the flow might look like between different components.

### How was AI used?

I'm going to do a play by play of the prompts I used, and what I got from the responses.

1. I asked "I am working on developing an app that users log in to, and I want to explore what options I have for authorizing a user when they log in. Can you give me a list of some ways to do that?"

   It gave me many options (which I skimmed, seeing some familiar names) and then asked me "Would you like examples in code (e.g., for Node.js, Django, etc.), or want help picking the best one based on your app's structure or tech stack?"

2. "Actually, it might be more helpful to think about the process of how they actually log in first. How about that?"

   It corrected me on authentication vs authorization (oops, silly me, I shoulda remembered this), then gave me a list of more helpful results.

3. I singled out "passwordless authentication" because we had talked about it in the past, and then I asked this.

   "Let's start by looking into passwordless authentication. Can you give me a short (1-3 sentence) summary of both "magic link" and "one time code"?"

   It did a good job at this.

4. I asked, "I've been wanting to use OTP, but one problem I was worried about is whether the user would need to log in and do a one-time code every time they opened the app. Would that be a concern?"

   It brought up storing a token on the device, and highlighted that it would be important to set an expiry so that the token would not be misused or stolen. For security.

5. I said "I want to hear more about token expiry and refreshing. Could you give me a little bit more detail? This might also be the right time to bring up the software stack: I am using Express for the API. Is there any sort of builtin solution, or would it be one I implement?"

   This was a multipart question, and it gave a long answer. These are the things I got from it.

   * to do this, you use both Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens.

     * access tokens last a short time (~15min) are are passed with each API request as authorization.
     * refresh tokens last longer (~7 days) and you keep it in secure storage on the device.
     * you use the refresh token to request new access tokens when they expire, and to request new refresh tokens when needed.
       * so an API endpoint to refresh them. you can refresh both, which stops the refresh token from expiring.

6. I thanked ChatGPT for its help, because I'm allowed to positively influence the data that's stored about me.

7. Later I came back and asked "I have one last question that should be quick. The server obviously has to store these tokens somewhere, but how does it know when to delete them from storage? And is it important to encrypt them somehow?"

   It answered that access tokens don't get stored on the server, just verifies them. This is a JWT thing.

   For refresh tokens, it said that those do need to get stored (e.g. in a database) and it's important to encrypt them so they don't get used for bad purposes.

   For cleaning them out, it said you can delete them when a user logs out and also have a cron job that runs every once in a while and cleans any that got missed.

8. That was a satisfactory answer to me, so I thanked it again and decided to be done.

### What impact did it have?

It had a large impact on the design of things going forward, provided other team members are okay with and agree with the things it said. I was keeping a critical eye to possible inaccuracies, but I want to also bring in the feedback of another dev who knows more about this sort of stuff so I can make sure I'm not messing things up by going in this direction.

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?

Since I specifically wrote the goals and expectations before hand, I followed them pretty closely and it matched well.

I ended up deciding not to ask for any sort of diagram, since I decided this was not information that would be helpful to me right now. Besides, I have no idea if it would do a good job at making a diagram or not--natural language is what it's built for.

### Optional Questions

For this response I'll answer them, but not with as much text as if I were turning them in. The goal is to make discussion easier without requiring a lot of extra work.

6. Helped learning, avoided sifting through generated and slop articles which are all I get trying to search this stuff up.

7. I'm taking its advice at face value, and if it were telling me things that were wrong and I went forward that could have implications on the security of our software and our users' data.

   Also, like with all Gen AI on the market, each query I make has massive environmental consequences! I don't like using AI! And yet I did anyway, and I made a lot of queries since I am not awesome at prompting. Bad.

8. It's good at planning stuff, but also I really really hate to recommend people use AI under pretty much any circumstance.

9. I think current policies are good because they require citation. I don't really care about the difference for using AI for one purpose versus another though, so that distinction has never had much of an impact on how I approach the course.

## Understanding how to make a Swift view update when a value changes in another view

This experiment was done by Michael.

### What were initial goals and expectations?

My initial goal was to understand how to update our event list view when the date we were looking at changed. I needed to do this because where the date we were looking at was stored in a different view than the event list.

I expected the AI to at least give me an easier to understand explantion of how to do what I wanted than all the documentation online.

### How was AI used?

I started by asking ChatGPT how to update a view in Swift when a value in another view changed. This gave me a decent explanation, but I still did not know how to fully implement it. So, I pasted in a portion of my code into ChatGPT and it was able to give me an explanation that was in the context of my code.

I also ended up using ChatGPT to read a bunch of event JSON data and give me a list of the tags in alphabetical order. This was used to make my event tags enum.

### What impact did it have?

This had a very large impact. I had been stuck on this problem for hours and could not find anything helpful online. It helped me more fully understand how I should set up my code and what things like @Binding and @Published meant in Swift.

Using AI to read all the event tags as had a huge impact. I saved a bunch of time by not doing it manually.

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?

The impact matched my goals and expectation very well. In fact, it was even more helpful than I originally thought. I was pretty skeptical of it to start with.

## Understanding how to utilize persistent states and local databases in Kotlin

This experiment was done by Anthony.

### What were initial goals and expectations?

My initial goal was to create a schema to store states, event information, etc. that would persist after the app had been closed and swiped up on. After prior research explained in later sections I had the expectation that utilizing AI would allow me to have a deeper and more connected understanding of creating this storage within the framework of our app.

### How was AI used?

To do this I had done some prior research to the experiment on what resources might exist (google searches "how would I keep app preferences post closing app in Jetpack Compose Kotlin?", Tutorials "Caching data from an API in jetpack compose", etc.) and after I felt like I had a general understanding of what resources were available I started by doing what I could with the understanding I had to implement this into our app. When I hit a hiccup where I felt confused or not fully clear what I was missing I would ask ChatGPT "This is how I understand x y and z in jetpack composed, without providing code can you explain the gaps in my understanding?" I asked likely 50 plus questions like this or similar like "Do you have resources that may be able to fill these gaps?" to do my best to fill these gaps in understanding. Sometimes it was helpful and other times googling helped significantly more. Additionally there were times I asked prompts like "generally can you write out a code process for x?" This allowed me to get a general framework to work off of how something could be implemented (Note I did not take the code or copy it just used it as a mental structure for how I could do something). This was super helpful in putting together the mental model of how a local db was going to operate, with the actually implementation side of things.

### What impact did it have?

The impact was pretty significant as it allowed me to ask pretty specific questions and since I could provide a specific background about our projects and some of the languages we were using to implement our app it was able to give my very specified feedback on my understanding and how to go about these connections or the libraries that exist. In the end it allowed us to have an app with persisting states and information so the overall product impact was quite high.

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?

I actually generally expected it to help less than it did. It was really a lot better and providing more specific feedback to really help me when I hit a specific gap in knowledge. Additionally, I feel as though I was expecting to begin to curate my messages/prompts to the degree that I did. I feel like I learned a lot about prompts for example if starting a chat you want to provide as much background info about your topic as possible and provide as much detail as you can about your understanding or specific use case for some new thing you want to implement. "I am making an events app for grinnell college, currently I have persisting states using datastores for certain app preferences like darkmode light mode, login state, etc. Currently I am working on a Room Database and currently I have an API I get my events from, but when I try to upsert these events to my Room DB it doesn't upsert. What are reasons maybe with how I am creating my events table that might cause an upsert to not occur? (Please just explain do not code)" This prompt gave me pivotal information about the need for type convertors for certain data types in Room DB tables. Curation of similar prompts and my learning of how to curate these questions really evolved and I think that really surprised me during this process.

## Troubleshooting API to send and verify codes
This experiment was completed by Ellie.

### What were initial goals and expectations?
By the time I approached this experiment, I had reason to believe I'd implemented an API route that should send a verification code to a user's email, as well as potentially one to verify the code on return, but I was having a hard time testing this using just the exisiting manual testing procedure.

### How was AI used?
This experiment was conducted using ChatGPT. I have a free account, so the model was the default free account model (I believe this is GPT-4o)

My prompts involved the CLI thing I was trying to run, followed by an the result/error I got, and a question I had. Sometimes, where relevant, it also included the source code associated with the call I was trying to make. Before I took to AI I had
   1. Written the API call code
   2. Read and ran the existing manual testing procedure
I did these things so I was prepared to come to AI with specific questions, and my hope (not necessarily realized, more on this later) was that I could avoid having to copy and paste in an entire codebase.

### What impact did it have
The best way I can describe its impact was "swingy". In some cases, it was pretty useful: for example, when I didn't yet have the sqlite3 module despite having marked it as required, it was useful in telling me how to resolve that error (I needed to run npm install). However, when I was having more specific errors (such as the request seemingly not being recieved despite the API running) (that maybe didn't conform as well to its training), it had much less useful advice to give and asked for increasingly large amounts of source code to be copied in. Despite my doing so (and telling it this specifically), it kept confusing a POST request for a GET request, and mostly told me places I might want to put console logs, rather than identifying what was actually wrong. This went on until the amount of code it needed didn't seem tenable to fit in a single request, and also came out of several different files, so using AI proved increasingly cumbersome. I also was beginning to worry about the ethical implications of feeding it so much of my group's code to potentially train on, so at this point I called the experiment off. I was left with code full of a bunch of console logs, and requests that still did not appear recieved. The issue ended up being fixed during a pair programming session with Almond later that night.

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?
After everyone else's AI experiments, and the general idea I've seen spreading that debugging is a use case where AI can be quite strong, I had really high hopes for this, but it was ultimately pretty disappointing. It caught the low hanging fruit errors like the missing passage, but as soon as I got to the meat of the struggle, it became a lot less impactful. With each error, it would request more and more source code to try to help me resolve it, and seemed to just not acknowledge that I had explicitly told it the advice it was giving that I had already tried (it gave me the same advice repeatedly, which did not work). I learned that its efficacy is very much tied with the amount of context it has, which isn't surprising, but was a little unpleasant because there was a lot of intertwined code from different places it allegedly "needed": yet giving it didn't really improve its performance much. I concede that for errors associated with big libraries, it can do pretty well since its maybe seen things of that form before, but it is less good at diagnosing and fixing errors that are really local in nature.

## Understanding how to utilize persistent states and local databases in Swift
This experiment was done by Budhil
### What were initial goals and expectations?
The goal of this was to figure out how to use persistent states and create a local database. 
My expectation was that it was going to completely help me find the right libraries to use, and use the right functions to have persistent states and caching. 

### How was AI used?
Initially, the AI (Claude, ChatGPT and Deepseek), were asked to provide a guide to how to store data into a local database _using SQLite_. Specifying SQLite was a mistake, I will mention that in the next section. I then asked how to download GRBD (for SQLite), and it gave correct instructions.
After some issues, I again asked it to guide me through usage on SwiftData (the right caching method), and then some later issues that showed up in the usage of SwiftData, which was the ArrayTransformer. 

### What impact did it have?
It successfully guided me through using the libraries I specified, but it did NOT robustly explain me the usage of SwiftData (a week before I started using SwiftData), or the existence of it. Even just GRBD utilization was difficult, but when I gave it the guide and the instructions on the GRBD documentation, and asked it to explain it more in detail, it did so successfully. 
When helping with SwiftData, it was very helpful. Explaining the configurations of the modelcontext (explained in the invisible section of our review) was not so helpful. However, there was a big bug with arraytransformer where EventDTOs were not able to be converted into a EventModel (@Model), and the AI could not figure out why. In fact it took about 10 prompts with Claude and it STILL didn't figure out the issue. Until, I asked ChatGPT (even though I personally don't like ChatGPT...), and it figured out that it was an ArrayTransformer issue. I then went back to claude and mentioned that it was an arraytransformer issue, and it created it successfully and very quickly. 

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?
I think I gave Claude too much credit, and I realize there must be more specificity to my prompts. Overall, the AIs were SUPER helpful for exposing me to new techniques and functions. HOWEVER, if I did not specify the structure of certain things, there was a lot of things that were left unexplained. However, when I took my time to create a more explanatory prompt (and to not give me answers), the AI model successfully helped me learn as well as get work done more efficiently. 

## Timed Notifications for Kotlin

This was done by Ethan on their own.

### What were initial goals and expectations?

Written after the experiment

The goal is to get working code for a timed notification on the android version of our app. I want a useful idea of where I should start and some help answering questions on the implementation

### How was AI used?

I'm going to do a play by play of the prompts I used, and what I got from the responses.

1. I asked "how to create timed notifications in kotlin?"

   It gave me two options one that uses a simple delay function that is probably not what I want as I beleive it wont resolve if the app is closed and a alrm system. I tried to impliment the alarm system but it didnt work right away

2. "java.lang.SecurityException: Caller com.example.myapplication needs to hold android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM or android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM to set exact alarms."

  I put the error directly into the AI. It gave a possible solution to the error but trying to implement it turned out to be just wrong. I lloked at the error close rand found a solution by better understanding the error. 

3. "fun scheduleNotification(event: Event) {
        val intent = Intent(context, NotificationReceiver::class.java)
        val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
            context,
            0,
            intent,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT or PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        )

        val alarmManager = context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE) as AlarmManager
        val delayInMillis = 60
        val triggerAtMillis = System.currentTimeMillis() + delayInMillis

        alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
            AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
            triggerAtMillis,
            pendingIntent
        )
    } why wont I get a notification ".

   Next I tried just throwing in the section of code and seeing if it could tell me why it wasnt working. It gave a couple of reasons for potential failure and a new piece of code. I tried fixing the things they mentioned then just copied and pasted the code. It still didnt work. 

5. I asked, "how do i fill the intent"

 This was a specific question to fix a something it had mentioned before. Suposedly this could help display the correct notification. It still didnt work

6. I asked for a "function to find the difference in dates in milliseconds in kotlin"

   The aswer turned out to be much simpler than I had aanticipated 
fun getDifferenceInMillis(date1: Date, date2: Date): Long {
    return date2.time - date1.time
} But it was still useful and found what I wanted quickly
   

8. I said "min in miliseconds"

   It gave me a short snippet with the correct code. This was actualy useful

### What impact did it have?

It was a kinda frustrating tool to use but seems to work best as a search bar equivelent but obsfuscates who is actualy credited for the code. I guess I found it mildly useful but I think it had a low overall impact.

### To what extent did this impact match goals and expectations?

Since I specifically wrote the goals and expectations before hand, I followed them pretty closely and it matched well.

It fell below my expectations for how usable its responses were. It was frustrating and unethical to use in my opinion.
