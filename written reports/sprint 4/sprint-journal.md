# Internal Documentation Lab

## Group Anthony and Michael

### A: Anthony B: Michael

We worked on the login process code for Kotlin.

We made no code changes but furthered documentation. We added inline comments above the async functions in the AuthModel file. We added documentation to the Login Screen file specifically to explain which chunks corresponded to which UI elements and what all they did (specifically useful for the login button). Added inline comments to specific branching/conditionals that may be confusing when not knowing what is being evaluated.

The function headers and data class headers were helpful in understanding what each data class was used for or what a function did specifically.

Our issue tracker was up to date on what the next step entailed.

We worked on the homepage for Swift.

We made no code changes but furthered documentation. We added a header comment to the enum class for tags. We added a header comment to the home screen discussing what each UI option did so that it was easy to discern what they were used for.

The in line comments for the homescreen were helpful specifically for which brackets closed which statements. Additionally the comments on the specific values of the variables.
