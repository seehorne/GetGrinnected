# Sprint 1 Review Report
## Period 2/17 - 3/2

During this sprint, our team has completed vital prototyping in order to identify and improve problem areas of the user interface. This can be seen through our paper prototype of the app, including signup, searching and favoriting events, and creating new events as an organizer role. We have also created a storyboard showing an example of how our app will fit into the lives of our users.

These visible products are not the only things we have successfully accomplished, however. We have tested our paper prototype with various stakeholders, ranging from our class mentor to other students in the class to complete outsiders to the app. From these interactions and feedback sessions, we've formed a substantially more fleshed-out view of how this app should be implemented and what features users care about having. By completing in-class activities such as following the CIDER technique on our product, we have also improved considerations of the accessibility of our app.
