        -  SUMMARIZE NOTES?

- Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
    - Ensure we are not talking over test user when they are providing feedback
        - It is great to have ideas to fix or solve a problem, but very important to fully hear out the test user. Their thought process is crucial! (Proposing possible ideas for solutions after they have provided their full thoughts is a great idea!).
