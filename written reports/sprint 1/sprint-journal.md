#### Feedback from tester

Calendar: How do I get to different views? (It needs to be more obvious how to change)

Calendar: A month view as the default is overwhelming, maybe a week view or a day view would be better.

Calendar: When in week view, can you swipe and/or press a button to change what week you are viewing? This would be good to add, intuitive way to want to interact.

Calendar: The day view where events are shown as overlapping is good.

Events: How do I know if an event is recurring?

Events: When I am creating event, how do I mark it as recurring? [After some explanation] Maybe that could be done differently to be more intutitive.

TO DO: Others?

    - Ability to filter Calendar View?

#### Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user

- Ensure we are not talking over test user when they are providing feedback
    - It is great to have ideas to fix or solve a problem, but very important to fully hear out the test user. Their thought process is crucial! (Proposing possible ideas for solutions after they have provided their full thoughts is a great idea!).

####  Changes to prototype

Based on user feedback:
- Update calendar to meet a few areas.
    - This involved changing the verbiage on the time view button from "time: day/month/year" to "view: day/month/year" to make it clearer it was switchable, to address confusion around how to switch between day, week, and month views
        - This also involved making the button for this in color rather than pencil, so it was more clearly interactable
    - Similarly, made the filter button colorable to show it is interactable, made a list of tags, and made some example screens with filters turned on to show what a filtered calendar might look like
    - Made additional screens for week and day views to simulate side scrolling to access the next time period, as this was an intutitive way the user tried to navigate in the calendar.
- User profile: Add account switcher, area for the orgs you follow.
- TO DO: Are there others?

Hope this looks okay. Had to use HTML `<img>`-s so I could control the width and stop these taking up like 12 pages.
