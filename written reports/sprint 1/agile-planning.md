    - 4 beans out of 5
- Ellie: Midterm next Fri (28th), so end of next week is bad.
    - 3 - 3.5 beans out of 5
- Budhil: Should be okay this sprint, really big assignment due this Friday and weekly essays. Should be manageable.
    - 3.5 beans out of 5
- Anthony: Pretty loaded Fri-Sat-Sun 28th-2nd, but otherwise relatively free. Can find time on weekend, just not meet.
