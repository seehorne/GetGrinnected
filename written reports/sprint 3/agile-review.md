# Sprint 3 Review Report

**Period:** 3/31 - 4/8

This sprint's review is what you described in the Sprint 3 Requirements document.

> For each user-facing feature that is operational, describe steps to activate that feature in the user interface. The steps should be clear enough that your instructor can follow them while grading your work, without help from your team.

Since there are two frontends, there are two sets of steps.

# Kotlin Frontend

TODO: CHANGES ARE INEVITABLE, BUT CHANGING PARTS IS EASIER THAN STARTING OVER. UPDATE BEFORE SUBMISSION.

## Installing the app

1. Clone the project from Github.

2. Install Android Studio, and open this path within the GitGrinnected repo as a project: `src/android/GetGrinnected/MyApplication`.

3. Follow these steps to run the app on your device. I recommend connecting to your device over USB, rather than WiFi. <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device>

    - When you run the app, make sure the dropdown menu at the top (next to the green play and debug icons) is set to "MyApplication.app".

## Login

1. After starting the app, click the "Login" button.

2. Optionally, type in the "Username" and "Password" field. You can enter anything, currently logins are not checked.

3. Optionally, click the "Join Now" text in the bottom message to jump to the "Sign Up" page.

4. Click the "Login" button to go to the "Home" page.

## Sign Up

1. After starting the app, click the "Sign In" button

2. Optionally, enter text in the fields. They are not checked yet.

3. Optionally, click the "Sign in" text in the bottom message to jump to the "Login" page.

4. Click the "Sign In" button to go to the "Home" page.

## Home

1. Look at the example event cards shown for the current date.

2. Optionally, click the date on the top bar to open a dropdown and change which date is being shown.

    - Currently, this will have no effect on visuals.

3. Click any of the other icons on the bottom bar to go to their pages.

## Calendar

1. Click the "Week" button in the top left to open a dropdown and change between Day, Week, and Month views.

2. Notice that the background text changes for each view.

3. Click any of the other icons on the bottom bar to go to their pages.

## Favorites

1. Click on any of the event cards shown to expand the description.

2. Optionally, click on the heart next to an event to unselect it.

    - Currently, unhearting an event does not do anything.

3. Optionally, scroll through the list of cards.

4. Click any of the other icons on the bottom bar to go to their pages.

## Settings

1. Nothing is currently on the settings page, except for the text showint it exists.

2. Click any of the other icons on the bottom bar to go to their pages.

# Swift Frontend

TODO: ALMOND CANNOT DO THIS.

## What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

As instructed, this has been summarized in the Sprint Journal instead. Look under the "Non User-Facing Progress" header.

# Git Diff Link

This diff shows the changes we made to our codebase over the course of this sprint: <https://github.com/seehorne/GetGrinnected/compare/sprint2..sprint3>

Note: If you click the link before the `sprint3` tag is pushed to Github, the diff will appear to be empty.
