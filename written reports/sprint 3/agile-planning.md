<https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQEmmlavGyxSauyoVOYy1wlG60n2Tfj2XITrccAnhdqEg28_v90Pjd1ffN7_MI_DZ6je4iuEHvWA1ou/pub>

### Solidify toolchain, processes, and instructions.
- README.md contains:
    - Clearly labeled instructions for how to build and test the system. (Strive for a high degree of automation.)
    - Clearly labeled instructions for how to run the system.
    - Based on the provided instructions, your instructor must be able to build and test the system without issues.
- Sprint journal contains:
    - A summary of non-user-facing progress for this milestone.

### End-to-end implementation
- Touches all major components of the system
- Demo-ready.
    - Tag whatever commit we use for the demo so that it can be IDed easily
- README.md contains:
    - What is operational right now (updated as we go. Use a markdown checklist, almond suggests.)
- Sprint review contains:
    - For each operational user-facing feature, steps to activate it.
- Sprint journal contains:
    - Name of the git tag for the commit containing your demo code.
