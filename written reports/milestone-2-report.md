# Important Decisions
Coming to our decision, we were considering our main goal: how to get our application launched as swiftly as possible. As such, we (collectively) noted how difficult launching an application on Apple will be, and as such concluded pretty swiftly that we needed to use Swift for our front-end language for IOS. Second, we noted that although we could use any language for the android front-end, the most popular framework is Kotlin, and as such we concluded that we should go with the Android front-end. Lastly, we needed a well-rounded and robust back-end language that is compatible both to Swift and Kotlin--some suggestions like Typescript, Node.js, and javascript were made. We opted against Typescript because it was just going to be Node.js with additional steps (for the simplicity of our application), and javascript would be too difficult to straight up use. Additionally, the active user-base for Node.js led us to conclude our discussion by landing on Node.js.  As such, our final decision was Swift (iOS front-end), Kotlin (Android front-end), and Node.js (backend). 
In determining our database, we decided that we can always change our decision afterwards, but concluded with something that was (1) college approved, (2) free to use, and (3) compatible with the languages we chose. As such, we concluded with SQLite, as something that one of our team members has already had experience with (Anthony), and something that was relatively easy to learn (according to Anthony).
